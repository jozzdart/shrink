### ‚úÇÔ∏è **shrink** ‚Äî _because every byte counts._

**`shrink`** is a lightweight Dart package for fast, reliable data compression and decompression.  
With a clean and intuitive API like `.shrink()` and `.restore()`, it makes it easy to reduce the size of strings, bytes, JSON, and unique integer lists‚Äîperfect for storage, sync, or transmission.

Built for production, `shrink` helps you **cut cloud storage and bandwidth costs** with reductions ranging from **5√ó to 40√ó** (and sometimes even more).

> Same data. A fraction of the size. Ready for Firebase, local storage, or fast sync.

### ‚ú® Shrink Anything in One Line

Compression is as easy as calling `.shrink()` on your data ‚Äî no setup, no boilerplate.

```dart
final shrinked = data.shrink(); // ‚¨áÔ∏è Compress your data
```

Or use the static `Shrink` class for clarity:

```dart
final shrinked = Shrink.json(data);
```

> Works with: `String`, `Map<String, dynamic>`, `Uint8List`, and `List<int>` (unique IDs)

---

### üîì Restore Instantly

To get your original data back, just call `.restoreX()` on the compressed value:

```dart
final restored = shrinked.restoreJson(); // ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Restore original content
```

Or use the static `Restore` class:

```dart
final restored = Restore.json(shrinked);
```

> Every `shrink` operation is **lossless** ‚Äî the restored value is identical to the original.

---

### What Can I Shrink?!

> In almost every real-world scenario ‚Äî from network packets and sensor logs to text content and protocol buffers ‚Äî **data is not truly random**. Even when it _appears_ non-repetitive at a low level, real data almost always contains some form of structure, patterns, or repetition. This is why in typical use, shrink reduces data size by 5√ó to 10√ó. However, in some edge cases ‚Äî such as highly structured or predictable data ‚Äî compression can reach 100√ó, 1,000√ó, or even 1,000,000√ó smaller. For example, a 1MB list of sequential IDs can shrink to just a few bytes.

### üî¢ `List<int>` (Unique Integers)

- Compression: **4√ó ‚Äì 200√ó**
- Designed for non-repeating IDs (e.g., inventory item IDs).
- Uses adaptive compression: automatically selects the most efficient method (delta encoding, run-length, chunked, or bitmask), depending on the data pattern.

### üß† `Uint8List` (Raw Bytes)

- Compression: **3√ó ‚Äì 30√ó**
- Ideal for binary data or serialized objects.

### ‚úçÔ∏è `String` (Text)

- Compression: **3√ó ‚Äì 30√ó**
- Useful for logs, messages, or descriptions.

### üì¶ `Map<String, dynamic>` (JSON)

- Compression: **3√ó ‚Äì 30√ó**
- Perfect for structured data, especially when storing in Firebase or similar.

#### ‚úÖ Extension API (`.shrink()` ‚Üí `.restoreX()`)

| Data Type         | Shrink           | Restore                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| Unique Integers   | `items.shrink()` | `shrinked.restoreUnique()` |
| Text (String)     | `text.shrink()`  | `shrinked.restoreText()`   |
| JSON (Map)        | `data.shrink()`  | `shrinked.restoreJson()`   |
| Bytes (Uint8List) | `bytes.shrink()` | `shrinked.restoreBytes()`  |

#### üß± Static API (`Shrink.x()` ‚Üí `Restore.x()`)

| Data Type         | Shrink                 | Restore                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Unique Integers   | `Shrink.unique(items)` | `Restore.unique(shrinked)` |
| Text (String)     | `Shrink.text(text)`    | `Restore.text(shrinked)`   |
| JSON (Map)        | `Shrink.json(data)`    | `Restore.json(shrinked)`   |
| Bytes (Uint8List) | `Shrink.bytes(bytes)`  | `Restore.bytes(shrinked)`  |

### ‚¨áÔ∏è Shrinking in code

```dart
final shrinkedItems = items.shrink();         //   4 KB
final shrinkedText  = text.shrink();          //   8 KB
final shrinkedJson  = data.shrink();          //  12 KB
final shrinkedBytes = data.shrinkBytes()      // -------- For shrinking any data
```

Or use the static `Shrink` class for a clean, explicit API:

```dart
final shrinkedItems = Shrink.unique(items);
final shrinkedText  = Shrink.text(text);
final shrinkedJson  = Shrink.json(data);
final shrinkedBytes = Shrink.bytes(bytes);
```

### üîì Restoreing in code

Easily restore compressed data using `.restoreX()`:

```dart
final restoredItems = shrinkedItems.restoreUnique();
final restoredText  = shrinkedText.restoreText();
final restoredJson  = shrinkedJson.restoreJson();
final restoredBytes = shrinkedBytes.restoreBytes();
```

Or with the static `Restore` class:

```dart
final restoredItems = Restore.unique(shrinkedItems);
final restoredText  = Restore.text(shrinkedText);
final restoredJson  = Restore.json(shrinkedJson);
final restoredBytes = Restore.bytes(shrinkedBytes);
```

# üìä Benchmarks

`shrink` has been benchmarked with a variety of real-world data scenarios, including:

- Raw bytes: random, repetitive, alternating, zero-filled
- JSON: flat, nested, arrays, and complex structures
- Lists of unique integers: sequential, sparse, dense, and special patterns

Compression results vary depending on the input but can reach up to **200,000√ó** reduction in size. All tests are validated and performance-logged.

### üß© Bytes & Text Shrinking

In almost every real-world scenario ‚Äî from network packets and sensor logs to text content and protocol buffers ‚Äî **data is not truly random**. Even when it _appears_ non-repetitive at a low level, real data almost always contains some form of structure, patterns, or repetition:

- **Character frequency** in text (e.g., spaces, vowels, tags)
- **Binary signatures** in files and headers
- **Zero-padded or default values** in structured formats
- **Protocol overhead** in serialized data

That‚Äôs why compression can be so effective even on data that doesn‚Äôt look obviously redundant.

Shrink leverages this reality and combines compression strategies to achieve significant reductions for most data types.

#### üì¶ Compression Results (Bytes & Text)

| Data Pattern       | Input Size (Bytes) | Shrink Size | Space Saved | Factor    |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ----------- | ----------- | --------- |
| Random (1KB)       | 1,000              | 1,011       | `None`      | `No gain` |
| Repetitive (1KB)   | 1,000              | 27          | **97.3%**   | **37.0√ó** |
| Alternating Bytes  | 1,000              | 18          | **98.2%**   | **55.6√ó** |
| Mostly Zeros       | 1,000              | 73          | **92.7%**   | **13.7√ó** |
| Large Random (1MB) | 1,048,576          | 1,048,907   | `None`      | `No gain` |

> üí° In Shrink, when compression doesn‚Äôt help, it‚Äôs intelligently skipped ‚Äî so there‚Äôs no overhead.

### üìÑ JSON Shrinking

| Type                  | Original Size | Shrink Size | Space Saved | Factor    |
| --------------------- | ------------- | ----------- | ----------- | --------- |
| Simple Flat           | 51            | 52          | `None`      | `No gain` |
| Deeply Nested & Small | 85            | 62          | 27.06%      | 1.37√ó     |

| Huge Sequential (50k) | 200,000       | 5           | 100.00%     | 40,000√ó |

### üß† Auto-Selected Compression Examples

Shrink automatically selects the best compression strategy based on your data:

| Data Type     | Original Size | Shrink Size | Space Saved | Factor |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------ |
| Mixed IDs     | 4,800         | 14          | 99.71%      | 343√ó   |
| Multi-Modal   | 6,000         | 1045        | 82.58%      | 5.74√ó  |
| Simulated IDs | 12,000        | 3199        | 73.34%      | 3.75√ó  |

# üî¨ How It Works Under the Hood

The `shrink` package is designed for production environments where **data savings**, **ease of use**, and **data integrity** matter most. Under the hood, each supported data type is compressed using a specialized and optimized algorithm, and decompressed using metadata-aware logic. All compression is **lossless**.

### üì¶ `Uint8List` (Raw Bytes)

When using `Shrink.bytes(...)`, the input is evaluated with multiple algorithms:

- **Identity** (no compression)  
  Useful when compression would increase the data size.

- **ZLIB** (levels 1‚Äì9)  
  Fast and widely supported, good for structured data.

- **GZIP** (levels 1‚Äì9)  
  Slightly larger output, but better for HTTP-compatible scenarios.

The smallest result is selected automatically.  
The **first byte** of the compressed output encodes the method used, so `Restore.bytes(...)` can safely reverse the process.

---

### üìù `String` (Text)

Strings are first encoded as UTF-8, then compressed using **Bytes Shrinking**.  
This strikes a balance between compression ratio and decoding speed, ideal for text-heavy content.

```dart
final compressed = 'hello world'.shrink();
final original = compressed.restoreText();
```

---

### üîß `Map<String, dynamic>` (JSON)

JSON is compressed in two steps:

1. **Minify** the data with `jsonEncode` (removes unnecessary whitespace).
2. **Compress** the resulting string with UTF-8 + _Bytes Shrinking_.

This results in excellent size reductions, especially for structured but repetitive data.

```dart
final compressed = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}.shrink();
final restored = compressed.restoreJson();
```

---

### üî¢ `List<int>` (Unique Integers)

For lists of **unique integers**, `shrink` tries four specialized methods:

- **Delta + Varint Encoding**  
  Great for sorted lists with small gaps.

- **Run-Length Encoding**  
  Best when values appear in long consecutive runs.

- **Chunk-Based Encoding**  
  Suitable for values that form localized clusters.

- **Bitmask Encoding**  
  Excellent for dense ranges (e.g., 0‚Äì1000 with few missing values).

The algorithm selects the **most space-efficient method** and stores its index in the first byte.

You can also manually choose the method using `.shrinkManual(...)`, though this is NOT RECOMMENDED since the automatic selection ensures optimal data compression by testing all methods.

```dart
final compressed = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6].shrink();
final restored = compressed.restoreUnique();
```

# ‚úÖ Testing & Validation

All compression and restoration tools in `shrink` are:

- **Heavily tested** for correctness, reversibility, and edge cases.
- Guaranteed to **preserve exact original content** upon decompression.
- Validated across many types of real-world and synthetic data.
- Benchmarked for size reduction and decoding performance.

You can rely on `shrink` in **production environments** such as:

- Firebase and Firestore data storage
- Offline cache or local DBs
- Network transmission over low bandwidth
- Size-optimized APIs or backups

# üî• Firebase Integration Example

Storing large lists (like inventory, user items, or flags) in Firestore can get expensive ‚Äî especially when using arrays of integers. With `shrink`, you can compress the list into a tiny `Blob` field, saving both **space** and **money**, while preserving full data integrity.

### üì• Saving Compressed Data to Firestore

Let‚Äôs say each user has a list of owned item IDs:

```dart
final items = Inventory.getUserItems(); // [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...];
```

You can shrink this list and store it as a Firestore binary field:

```dart
import 'package:cloud_firestore/cloud_firestore.dart';
import 'package:shrink/shrink.dart';

final userId = 'abc123';
final compressed = items.shrink(); // or Shrink.unique(items)

await FirebaseFirestore.instance
  .collection('users')
  .doc(userId)
  .set({'items_blob': compressed}, SetOptions(merge: true));
```

### üì§ Restoring Data from Firestore

When you need the original list of items:

```dart
final doc = await FirebaseFirestore.instance
  .collection('users')
  .doc(userId)
  .get();

final compressed = doc['items_blob'] as Uint8List;
final restoredItems = compressed.restoreUnique(); // or Restore.unique(compressed)
```

### üí° Why Use Shrink?

- ‚úÖ **Drastically smaller payloads** (from KBs to just a few bytes)
- ‚úÖ **Safe and lossless** ‚Äî original data is perfectly restored
- ‚úÖ **Firestore-friendly** ‚Äî binary blobs are more efficient than large arrays
- ‚úÖ **Future-proof** ‚Äî compression method is encoded automatically

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è _Tip: You can use this approach for storing compressed JSON, logs, flags, or anything serializable into a list or string._

# üöÄ Roadmap & Future Plans
